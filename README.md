### Time-Series-Prediction-for-Accounting-Data
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the expenditure patterns of the Institute of Data Engineering,
Analytics and Science Foundation – Technology InnovationHub (IDEAS-TIH) for the financial year 2024–2025.
Utilizing invoice-level data from May 2024 to March 2025, the study employs descriptive statistics and visual
analytics to explore monthly spending trends, identify key expenditure categories, and detect patterns, seasonality,
and anomalies. The initial phase involves graphical representations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line
graphs to provide an intuitive understanding of the data. The second phase focuses on forecasting future
expenditures using time series models, including ARMA and SARIMA, implemented in Python. These models
are selected for their ability to account for both trend and seasonal variations in the data. The insights
derived from this analysis aim to support IDEAS-TIH in strategic financial planning, effective budgeting, and
data-driven decision-making, ultimately contributing to improved financial efficiency and resource management.
